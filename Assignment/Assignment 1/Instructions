CSE1322L Assignment 1
Define the following three classes:
1) Circle
a) Must have a private attribute called radius of type double.
b) Must have a constructor which takes a single parameter of type double. It
should set the class attribute radius to this value.
c) Must have a method called circumference, which takes no parameters,
and returns a double. The circumference of a circle is calculated by
multiplying 2 * Pi * radius. Note: both Java and C# have a constant called
Math.PI which is equal to Pi.
d) Must have a method called area, which takes no parameters and returns a
double. The area of a circle is calculated by multiplying Pi * radius^2. The
Math class in both Java and C# have a method for calculating one number
raised to a power. You’ll need to look up this method and use it to raise
the radius to the second power.
2) Triangle
a) Must have 3 private attributes to hold side1, side2 and side3. Each of
which should be of type double.
b) Must have a constructor that takes in 3 parameters and sets the 3
attributes
c) Must have an overloaded constructor that takes no parameters and sets
the 3 attributes to sizes 3, 4 and 5.
d) Must have a method called perimeter which takes in no parameters and
returns a double. The perimeter of a triangle is calculated by adding
side1+side2+side3
e) Must have a method called area which takes no parameters and returns a
double. The area of a triangle is calculated as follows (You’ll need to look
up the square root function in the Math object in Java or C#):
i) Calculate p=(side1+side2+side3)/2
ii) Take the square root of (p*(p-side1)*(p-side2)*(p-side3)).
f) Must have a method called height which takes no parameters and returns
a double. The height of a triangle is calculated as follows:
i) Find the smallest of the 3 sides (side1, side2 or side3)
ii) Multiple the area of the triangle by 2, then divide that by the
smallest side.
g) Override the toString/ToString method in this class. Have it return a string
that gives the details of the triangle. For example: “Triangle has sides x, y 
and z. It has an area of X and perimeter of Y”.
3) Rectangle
a) Must have 2 private attributes height and width. Both of which should be
of type double.
b) Must have a constructor which takes in 2 parameters and sets the 2
attributes of the class
c) Must have a method called perimeter which takes no parameters and
returns a double. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding
2*height + 2*width
d) Must have a method called area which takes no parameters and returns a
double. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the height by
the width.
Create a driver program which does the following:
1) Using a loop print out the area and circumference of circles with radius 1, 2, 3 …
9, 10. Here is what the first line should look like:
Area of a circle with radius 1 is 3.14159265358979 circumference is
6.28318530717959
2) Using nested loops, print out the area and perimeter of rectangles with width 1, 2
and 3 and heights 1, 2, and 3. ie, you’ll print out the area and perimeter for a
rectangle 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 3x1, 3x2, and 3x3. The first line should
look like:
Area of a rectangle 1 by 1 is 1 it's perimeter is 4
3) Create a triangle with sides 18, 30 and 24. Calculate its area, perimeter and
height and print them as follows:
Area of a triangle 18x30x24 is 216 it's perimeter is 72 and it's height is 24
4) Create a triangle of sides 3, 4, 5 by calling the constructor with no parameters.
Calculate its area, perimeter and height and print like the one above.
