CSE1322L - Lab 11
Background:
Have you ever written a program, saved a version, then later saved a different version and wish
you could tell what changed? Well the correct answer to this problem is to use a source control
system such as git, but for this lab, we are going to write a simple tool that shows what is
different between two files.
Steps:
1. You’ll need two text files to test your code. Using your favorite text editor (notepad on
windows, or textedit on mac, or similar) create two files with almost the same text in
each. Be sure to save it as a text (.txt) file, not a .doc or anything else.
2. Write a program to compare the two files and output their differences.
a. Prompt the user for both file names.
b. Open both files, and read them in line by line. Keep track of what line number
you are on.
c. Compare the line you read from file one, with the line you read from file two.
i. If they are the same, do nothing.
ii. If they are different, output the differences as follows:
1. You’ll first output the line number that is different,
2. Next, you’ll output the symbol “< ” and then the line from the first
file.
3. Finally, output a “> ” and the line from the second file.
d. If the two files have a different number of lines, you should output “Files have
different number of lines”/
3. Be sure to handle all IO exceptions that could occur.
Sample Output:
Line 1
< Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
> Humpty Dumpty tat on a wall
Line 3
< All the kings horses and all the kings men
> All the kings horss and all the kings men
