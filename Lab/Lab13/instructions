CSE1322L - Lab 13
Concept Summary:
In this lab you’ll be writing a program to keep track of your BlueRay collection. You’ll use
an object to describe an individual disk, which will include the title, director, cost and year
of release. Then you’ll utilize a linked list data structure to keep track of your collection.
Finally you’ll write a driver to allow you to add disks to your collection, as well as see the
current list of disks in your collection.
Tasks:
1. Write a BlueRayDisk class which has:
a. Public attributes called title and director (strings), year of release (int) and cost
(double).
b. Constructor which takes in the 4 attributes and sets the objects variables.
c. Override of toString/ToString which prints the objects variables as follows:
[Dollar sign]Cost [space] Year of release [Space] Title [comma] Director
$19.99 2019 Avengers - Endgame, Anthony Russo & Joe Russo
2. Write a node class which has a data field that holds a BlueRayDisk and a next field which
is a link to another node.
3. Write a BlueRayCollection class which has:
a. A private link called head that links to a Node, it should be initialized to null
b. A public method called add() which takes 4 parameters (title, director, year of
release, cost) and returns nothing. It should create a new Node and add it to the
end of the linked list.
c. A public method called show_all() which takes no parameters and returns nothing,
but prints out all the BlueRays in the collection. It should utilize the toString or
ToString method to print each BlueRay.
4. Write a main program which does the following:
a. Instantiate a BlueRayCollection
b. Present the user with a menu that gives the following choices:
0. Quit
1. Add BlueRay to collection
2. See collection
c. Read in the users choice. If they choose 1, prompt the user for a title, director,
year of release and year, and call the add method in the BlueRayCollection object
you created. If they choose 2, call the show_all method in the BlueRayCollection
object you created.
